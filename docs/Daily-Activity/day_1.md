# 1. Activity of Day 1

**Foundations of Modeling & Fabrication**

Modeling and fabrication work hand-in-hand throughout the design process. When I design, I consider not only the digital representation but also how computational thinking, material properties, and manufacturing methods will affect the final outcome. The physical realization of an idea is just as important as the concept itself.
Modeling goes beyond creating shapes on screen. It encompasses the representation of form, logic, behavior, and intelligent design systems. My approach includes:

Geometric Modeling – Working with shapes and spatial relationships
Parametric & Rule-Based Modeling – Developing designs that respond to changing parameters and defined rules
Simulation & Data-Driven Modeling – Leveraging computational tools and real-world information to guide design choices

Fabrication is where these digital models become tangible objects. This requires understanding how different materials behave, what machines can produce, and which processes work best for each application.
My Design-to-Fabrication Workflow
Rather than following a straight path, my design process cycles through multiple stages with constant refinement:

**Idea – Define what I want to achieve and why**

Model – Develop digital versions of my concepts
Prototype – Create early physical versions for testing
Fabricate – Execute the final production
Evaluate – Review results and identify improvements for the next iteration


**Activity 1 – Building a Documentation Website with MkDocs Material**

Documenting my work is essential for tracking progress, reflecting on what I learn, and sharing knowledge with others.
My Documentation Website
I built this website using MkDocs Material as a living record of my digital modeling and fabrication experience. Here I document my understanding of course concepts, track daily progress, note which materials and tools I use, reflect on challenges and successes, and showcase my results.

## Activity 2 – Publishing Documentation via GitHub Pages 

### From Local Project to Public Knowledge

Through this activity, I learned how to transform a local documentation site into a publicly accessible resource using GitHub and GitHub Pages. What started as files on my computer became a live website that anyone with internet access can view.

### Task Description
My goal was to take my MkDocs documentation project and make it available online by uploading it to GitHub and deploying it through GitHub Pages.
Uploading My Documentation Site to GitHub

### I followed these steps to publish my work:

Created a GitHub repository – Set up a new repository on GitHub to store and host my project files
Uploaded my MkDocs project – Used Git commands in the Git Bash terminal to push my local files to the repository, ensuring all content was properly tracked and version-controlled for deployment

#### Deploying Website 
- Enabled GitHub Pages  : Activated the GitHub Pages feature in the repository settings, which allows the project files to be hosted as a live website directly from GitHub.
- Deployed the site with a public URL : Once GitHub Pages was enabled, the site became accessible online via a public URL, making the documentation available to anyone without needing access to the repository.
