Activity of Day 1","text":"<p>Foundations of Modeling &amp; Fabrication</p> <p>Modeling and fabrication work hand-in-hand throughout the design process. When I design, I consider not only the digital representation but also how computational thinking, material properties, and manufacturing methods will affect the final outcome. The physical realization of an idea is just as important as the concept itself. Modeling goes beyond creating shapes on screen. It encompasses the representation of form, logic, behavior, and intelligent design systems. My approach includes:</p> <p>Geometric Modeling \u2013 Working with shapes and spatial relationships Parametric &amp; Rule-Based Modeling \u2013 Developing designs that respond to changing parameters and defined rules Simulation &amp; Data-Driven Modeling \u2013 Leveraging computational tools and real-world information to guide design choices</p> <p>Fabrication is where these digital models become tangible objects. This requires understanding how different materials behave, what machines can produce, and which processes work best for each application.
